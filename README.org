* Color Picker

** Installation

*** Windows

64-bit only, sorry. If someone needs a 32-bit version, contact me and
I will build one.

Download ~/build/windows/x64~. The DLLs are included (dynamic link),
so colorpicker.exe should just work.

*** Linux

Make sure you have the SDL2 libraries and SDL2_ttf libraries
installed, and then download ~/build/linux~. ~./colorpicker~ should
work.
